# 🔴 Bangla News Ticker - Chrome Extension 🇧🇩

A lightweight and real-time scrolling **Bangla news ticker** extension for Chrome — just like the news bars seen on TV channels like Jamuna TV or Prothom Alo.

✨ Headlines scroll continuously at the bottom of every webpage  
🌐 News auto-refreshes every few minutes  
📦 No login, no popup, just works silently
